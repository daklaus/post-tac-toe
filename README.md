# Post-tac-toe
Post-tac-toe is a generalized tic-tac-toe game written in the stack based language [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript).

The game is generalized in that it is an m,n,k,l-game (similar to the [m,n,k-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game)) where
- m stands for the number of rows of the field
- n stands for the number of columns of the field
- k stands for the number of marks in a row, column or diagonal a player needs to win the game
- l stands for the number of players

This implementation also supports the [random turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe_variants#Random_turn_tic-tac-toe) feature.
